## [Unreleased]

### Planned Features
- [ ] Multi-lead fusion (combine multiple ECG leads)
- [ ] Cross-dataset evaluation (train on PTB-XL, test on MIT-BIH)
- [ ] Model quantization (INT8) for mobile deployment
- [ ] ONNX export for production deployment
- [ ] Real-time inference optimization
- [ ] Adversarial robustness evaluation
- [ ] Attention mechanism visualization
- [ ] Web demo with Gradio
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] Pre-trained model zoo

### Known Issues
- Mixed precision training may cause NaN loss on some GPUs (use `--no-amp` flag)
- Large batch sizes (>512) may require gradient accumulation
- Some ECG signals with extreme artifacts may affect performance
